# ─── INJECT TIPS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
_TIPS = {1: 'BEMDAS appears in ~80% of SEC papers in Q1. Always show each step on a separate line — each step earns marks even if you make an arithmetic error later.', 2: 'HCF/LCM: the most common error is confusing HCF (lowest powers) with LCM (highest powers). Prime factorisation always works and is worth showing in full.', 3: 'Directed numbers are tested inside almost every algebra question. The most penalised error: not using brackets around negative substitutions, e.g. x=−3 must become (−3)²=9.', 4: 'Fractions appear in Q1 and embedded in algebra. The SEC awards marks for showing the LCD step even if the final answer is wrong — never skip it.', 5: '% change is in every paper. Always divide by the ORIGINAL value. Two successive % changes must be applied separately — never add the percentages together.', 6: "Venn diagrams appear in Q6 most years. Always fill the INTERSECTION (both) first, then find 'only A' and 'only B' by subtracting. Formula |A∪B|=|A|+|B|−|A∩B| is in the Tables booklet.", 7: 'Ratio and tax questions: always calculate each income tax band separately; subtract credits AFTER calculating gross tax. The multiplier method (×1.12 for VAT) is fastest.', 8: 'Algebra substitution: put negative values in BRACKETS every time. The examiner awards a method mark for your substitution step, even before any arithmetic is done.', 9: 'Expanding double brackets is tested in almost every Q2. The DoTS pattern (a+b)(a−b)=a²−b² saves time and is heavily used in later algebraic fractions questions.', 10: 'Factorising: SEC examiners award marks for each correct factor. Always CHECK by expanding — takes 10 seconds and can confirm or save 4 marks.', 11: 'Linear equations: the SEC always awards method marks for expanding brackets, collecting terms, and the final answer separately. Never skip showing the CHECK substitution.', 12: 'Simultaneous equations appear every year, often in word-problem context. The elimination method is most reliable. ALWAYS verify both values in BOTH original equations.', 13: 'Quadratic equations appear in at least 2 questions yearly. The quadratic formula is in the Tables & Formulae booklet — you must know when to use it. Check solutions by substituting back.', 14: "Sequence questions: common SEC pattern is (a) find Tₙ; (b) find a specific term; (c) 'is x a term?' Set Tₙ=value, solve for n. If n is a whole number, yes — it is in the sequence.", 15: 'Functions: always make a TABLE of at least 5 values before drawing — never sketch freehand. Roots and turning point are common part (c) questions worth significant marks.', 16: 'Algebraic fractions appear in Higher Level. Key: factorise BOTH numerator and denominator before cancelling. Only cancel FACTORS (things that multiply), never TERMS (things that add).', 17: "Mixed algebra mirrors the SEC format. Read all parts (a)(b)(c) before writing anything. 'Hence' means use your previous answer — the link is always deliberate and saves calculation.", 18: "Angle theorems: always NAME the theorem before applying it. 'By the Exterior Angle Theorem…' — naming earns marks in proofs even if a calculation step has errors.", 19: 'Circle Theorem 6 (angle at centre = 2×angle at circumference) is the most tested. Corollary (angle in semicircle = 90°) appears in nearly every SEC paper — know it cold.', 20: 'Constructions: never erase your compass arcs — they show the examiner you used the correct geometric method and earn construction marks even if the final shape is imprecise.', 21: 'Area and sectors: sector perimeter = arc + TWO radii (students often forget the two straight sides). All formulae are in the Tables booklet — use it for every calculation.', 22: 'Volume: composite solid questions are common. Calculate each part separately and ADD. Cone slant height l=√(r²+h²) must be calculated using Pythagoras — it is not given directly.', 23: 'Coordinate geometry: perpendicular slope (−1/m) is frequently needed. Remember: perpendicular means FLIP the fraction AND CHANGE the sign. m=3/4 → m⊥=−4/3.', 24: "Circle equations: practice 'state centre and radius', 'find where circle meets axes', and 'is point inside/outside?' These three are the most common part-types in SEC questions.", 25: 'SOH CAH TOA appears in every paper. Draw a labelled diagram FIRST. Calculator must be in DEGREE mode. Angle of elevation/depression is always measured from the HORIZONTAL.', 26: 'Sine/Cosine Rule decision: angle BETWEEN two sides and you know them → Cosine Rule. Know one angle and opposite side + another side → Sine Rule. Area=½ab sinC is in the booklet.', 27: 'Multi-step geometry: always show sub-answers clearly labelled. If an early step is wrong, consequential marks reward correct use of your wrong value in all subsequent steps.', 28: 'Coordinate geometry questions follow a consistent SEC pattern: (a) slope/distance/midpoint; (b) equation of line or circle; (c) intersection or inside/outside. Practice this 3-part structure.', 29: 'Statistics questions: drawing a neat, labelled frequency table — even if not explicitly asked — demonstrates organised thinking and earns presentation marks.', 30: 'Mean, median and IQR: the most common error is finding median WITHOUT ordering data first. Write the ordered list as your very first step — every time.', 31: 'Histograms: if class widths are EQUAL, y-axis can show frequency. If widths DIFFER, y-axis MUST show frequency density=freq÷class width. Check widths before drawing.', 32: 'Scatter diagrams: the line of best fit MUST pass through the mean point (x̄,ȳ). Mark the mean point as a cross on the diagram BEFORE drawing the line. Examiners look for this explicitly.', 33: 'Basic probability: P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B) ONLY for mutually exclusive events. If events can overlap (e.g. even AND prime on a die), always subtract P(A∩B) to avoid double-counting.', 34: 'Tree diagrams: without replacement — BOTH the total and the selected colour count must decrease after each draw. Always verify all terminal branches sum to exactly 1.', 35: "Counting principles: ask 'does order matter?' Roles (president, secretary) → order matters → Permutation nPr. Committees/groups → order doesn't matter → Combination nCr.", 36: 'Standard deviation and normal distribution: the 68-95-99.7 rule is the most tested. 68% within ±1σ; 95% within ±2σ. Show the full σ calculation step by step — each step earns marks.', 37: "Statistics exam part (c) is usually interpretation. Write at least 2 sentences, name BOTH variables, and cite the specific numbers you calculated. 'Positive correlation' alone is not enough.", 38: "CBA 2 at The 3 Amigos Tuition Centre is your statistical investigation. The most common weakness: vague conclusions. Always write: 'My data shows X because mean hours sport (Y) > mean hours music (Z).'", 39: 'Rapid-fire revision: in timed conditions, tackle questions you are MOST confident about first. Every mark counts — a simple BEMDAS question is worth the same as a hard algebra question.', 40: "Geometry revision: know what's in the Formulae & Tables booklet: trig ratios, Sine Rule, Cosine Rule, area, volume formulae. Never memorise what is given to you in the exam.", 41: 'Statistics revision: the most common lost marks are: median without ordering; IQR confused with range; line of best fit not through mean point; conditional probability wrong denominator.', 42: 'Mock Paper 1: time management — 8–10 minutes per question. If stuck after 3 minutes, write the formula and move on. Return at the end. A formula alone earns the method mark.', 43: 'Mock Paper 2: geometry rewards neat diagrams. Draw large, clear figures with all measurements labelled. Statistics: always show your frequency table BEFORE calculating the mean.', 44: 'Full mock: the real SEC paper has 10 questions with 3 parts each. Parts (a) and (b) are usually accessible — secure those first.
